## About Me

I'm a data scientist and bioinformatician with a Ph.D. from Ben-Gurion University.  
My research focused on integrating clinical metadata with transcriptomic and exome data to identify molecular subtypes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  
I specialize in interpretable machine learning, multi-omics analysis, and transforming complex biomedical datasets into actionable insights.

## Featured Project: The Fever Effect in ASD

**[Fever Effect – Full Repository](https://github.com/TalRichter/Fever-Effect)**  
Machine learning pipeline for predicting fever-related clinical responses in ASD using transcriptomic and clinical data.

This project includes:
- Interpretable XGBoost models with SHAP
- Bootstrap-based downsampling to address class imbalance
- Pathway-based outlier detection
- Spectral biclustering for subgroup discovery
- Differential expression analysis (DESeq2, edgeR)
